## :page_with_curl: About

React project developed by [Raphael Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelameidamartins/) at the end of Unit 17 ([Front-end Development Module](https://github.com/raphaelalmeidamartins/trybe_exercicios/tree/main/2_Desenvolvimento-Front-end)) of Trybe's Web Development course. We were approved with 100% of the mandatory and optional requirements met.

We had to develop a table React application fetching for StarWars planets' data from a public API. We also had to use the React Context API for state management.

### Note

This project is still under development. I still implementing the CSS and haven't deployed the application yet.
